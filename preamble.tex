\prefacesection{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my supervisor, Matthias Heil.
The help and support that I have received has been invaluable during this project.

Also his PhD students, Puneet Matharu and Jonathan Deakin.
Thank you for taking the time to talk through the many problems that I came up against.

Finally, I am grateful for all of the interesting discussions and biscuits at the Monday afternoon \texttt{oomph-lib} lunches.
These have introduced me to a wide range of topics that I would otherwise have not had access to.
