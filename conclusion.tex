\chapter{Conclusion}

The work completed in this project has led to the successful development of a solver for the Helmholtz equation in Fourier decomposed cylindrical coordinates.
We have built on the existing machinery for the Helmholtz equation in Cartesian coordinates and extended the 

Results gathered in the previous chapter demonstrate that the cylindrical Helmholtz equation behaves like the Cartesian version of the equation.
For example, the 

We discussed issues that could caused problems when finding the solution.
Namely, the problem

The shifted-Laplacian preconditioner works fine in the change of variables.

In summary, it has been shown that a multigrid based preconditioner for FGMRES is a viable method for solving the finite element discretisation of the Fourier decomposed Helmholtz equation in cylindrical coordinates.

\section{Further work}

Implement other boundary conditions, including absorbing boundary conditions using PML.
The current implementation of the work only handles Dirichlet boundaries.
This simplification was appropriate for initial work, but applications likely will involve non-essential boundaries.

Increasing the Fourier wavenumber $N$ causes issues.
This is likely because the variable coefficient term $N^2/r^2$ becomes more dominant.
To remedy the issue, we shift the mesh to increase the minimum value of $r$ so that it is approximately equal to $N$.
With an accompanying scaling of the equation, this solves the problem.
Implementing a more robust method for handling large $N$ and an accompanying convergence study should also be performed.
