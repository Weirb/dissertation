\section{Further work}

Implement other boundary conditions, including absorbing boundary conditions using PML.
The current implementation of the work only handles Dirichlet boundaries.
This simplification was appropriate for initial work, but applications likely will involve non-essential boundaries.

Increasing the Fourier wavenumber $N$ causes issues.
This is likely because the variable coefficient term $N^2/r^2$ becomes more dominant.
To remedy the issue, we shift the mesh to increase the minimum value of $r$ so that it is approximately equal to $N$.
With an accompanying scaling of the equation, this solves the problem.
Implementing a more robust method for handling large $N$ and an accompanying convergence study should also be performed.
