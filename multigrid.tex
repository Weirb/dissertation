\section{Multigrid methods}

Multigrid refers to a family of methods which use multiple grid levels in order to achieve high rates of convergence to solve linear systems.
Iteration converges rapidly for error components whose frequency components are high.
Conversely, iteration is slow for error components with low frequency components.
By transferring the residual to a coarser grid, the error components with low frequency in the fine grid have high frequency in the coarse grid.
Hence smoothing iterations converge rapidly for this new problem.
Now the solution is transferred back to the fine grid by interpolation and applying the coarse grid correction.
The description above is the outline for the two-grid method, on which many other multgrid methods are based.
